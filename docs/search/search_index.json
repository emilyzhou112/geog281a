This part of GIScience examines the georgaphic information and geographic concepts that are used by environmental and social scientists in their research.

It covers how spatial relations, objects, and processes are represented, calculated, and searched within finite-precision computing environments. This includes qualitative spatial reasoning frameworks, computational geometry, spatial indexing and retrieval methods, spatial statistics, and other geocomputational approaches such as map algebra and cellular automata.</p> <p>Cognition focuses on how humans perceive, conceptualize, reason about, and interact with geographic space and geographic information. It draws on psychology, cognitive science, and linguistics to study human understanding of spatial concepts such as distance, direction, regions, and relationships, often emphasizing qualitative and context-dependent reasoning rather than precise metrics.

Beyond technical concerns, it addresses the societal impacts of GIS, including issues of governance, equity, power, commercialization, and public participation. </p> <p>Cross-cutting Research Themes refer to fundamental issues that permeate all areas of GIScience rather than belonging to a single component.

He identifies three overlapping phases:</p> <ul> <li>Phase 1 (1960s-1980s): during which there was a strong and largely unproblematic relationship between Geography and GISystems. Geographers dominated education and research, and traditional practices in cartography and remote sensing were deeply embedded in early system design. GISystems moved steadily toward comprehensive handling of geographic information.</li> <li>Phase 2 (1990s-2000s): during which two major challenges emerged. First, many geographers began to question the intellectual merits of GISystems, a critique amplified by their widespread adoption in other disciplines. Second, GISystems were increasingly criticized for their social implications, including surveillance, privacy, and military origins. At the same time, research agendas broadened: data models became more complex, social critique entered GIS research, and GIS education expanded beyond geography departments.</li> <li>Phase 3 (2000s-present): during which data science, big data, consumer GIS, and computer science increasingly shape geospatial practice. Geography risks losing influence unless it continues to assert why spatial thinking matters.</li> </ul> <p>Goodchild warns that this new emphasis on data as the foundation of science, often ignoring how data are assembled, their provenance, and their relationship to the real world, is especially problematic. Effective and scientifically rigorous analysis becomes difficult without ground truth: knowledge of the geographic world gained through field observation, careful description, and attention to data quality.</p> <p>Without geographic thinking, GIS risks becoming data-driven computation divorced from social context, spatial reasoning, and geographic understanding. In this sense, the earlier concern about form and process reappears here at a disciplinary scale.</p> <p>A Related Detour:</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the rise of data science raises a parallel question: what kind of field is Geographic Data Science?</p> <p>Scheider et al. (2020) argue that GDS is not yet a scientific discipline, but rather a community of practice. A scientific discipline, they contend, must have its own concepts and its own questions. GDS currently does not. It borrows concepts from Geography, methods from GIScience, Statistics, and Machine Learning, and infrastructure from Computer Science <sup>1</sup>.</p> 2. Interestingly, this argument defends GIScience rather than replacing it. GIScience is framed as a meta-science, akin to Statistics or Information Science. Its role is not to answer geographic questions directly, but to study how geographic information is represented, measured, and reasoned with. This distinction becomes crucial in the discussions that follow."},{"location":"module1/giscience-geography/#the-geographicness-in-gis","title":"The Geographicness in GIS","text":"<p>Picking up on these concerns, Guan, Wilson, and Knowles (2019) explicitly ask what it means to emphasize the geographic in GIS.</p> <p>They argue that the geographic aspects of GIS remain insufficiently developed, and call for continued theoretical and methodological work to support a more geographic GIS.

However, GIS platforms often flatten these ideas into inflexible representations of points, lines, and polygons. As a result, GIS constrains how geographic thinking can be expressed, explored, and extended.</p> <p>While some argue that GIS primarily needs better qualitative tools, O\u2019Sullivan suggests that this would not make much difference. The deeper issue is that representational geometry itself is rigid. We do not need a whole new platform to \u201cdo GIS.\u201d Rather, it is essential to rethink the geographic representation model inside GIS and allow alternative spatial logics<sup>2</sup> to be implemented. As what he said:</p> <p>I am convinced that the task of reimagining and reconstructing GIS as a flexible tool for creating diverse human geographies \u2026 will depend on GISers taking geographical thought much more seriously than they have hitherto.</p> 2. non-Euclidean space, relational space, etc. <p>Speaking more broadly about representation, a major stumbling block for many critics of GIScience is its failure to take seriously the problematic nature of representation. Representation should be understood as process and practice, not as static objects. For example,</p> <p>The important question is not what a map is, nor what a map does, but how the map emerges through contingent, relational, context-embedded practices.</p> <p>This reframing shifts attention away from maps as finished products and toward the practices, assumptions, and decisions through which representations are produced.</p> <p>O\u2019Sullivan argues that we need to interrogate more closely what we mean by terms like related, near, and distant. Finding ways to recognize the fuzziness, ambiguity, porosity, and uncertainty of boundaries has the potential to open up new and different ways of seeing geographies. Doing so could set the stage for representing processes, events, and patterns explicitly, rather than treating familiar GIS entities as fixed and pre-given.</p> <p>Then,oOne way of \u201cdoing GIS\u201d today is to develop a vision that is both technical and critical. This requires taking the geographical in GIScience more seriously, and for geography to take GIScience more seriously as well. This leads to O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s primary conclusion:</p> <p>Geography and GIScience curricula at all levels should actively explore the common ground they share.</p> <p>There is no reason why an introductory GIS course cannot also be a class that critically examines fundamental geographic ideas\u2014doing so beyond a narrow focus on the technical issues that arise from working with existing representations.</p> <p>Reference:</p> <p>Goodchild, M.
