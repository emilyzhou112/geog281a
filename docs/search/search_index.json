This includes qualitative spatial reasoning frameworks, computational geometry, spatial indexing and retrieval methods, spatial statistics, and other geocomputational approaches such as map algebra and cellular automata.</p> <p>Cognition focuses on how humans perceive, conceptualize, reason about, and interact with geographic space and geographic information.

He identifies three overlapping phases:</p> <ul> <li>Phase 1 (1960s-1980s): during which there was a strong and largely unproblematic relationship between Geography and GISystems. Geographers dominated education and research, and traditional practices in cartography and remote sensing were deeply embedded in early system design. GISystems moved steadily toward comprehensive handling of geographic information.</li> <li>Phase 2 (1990s-2000s): during which two major challenges emerged. First, many geographers began to question the intellectual merits of GISystems, a critique amplified by their widespread adoption in other disciplines. Second, GISystems were increasingly criticized for their social implications, including surveillance, privacy, and military origins. At the same time, research agendas broadened: data models became more complex, social critique entered GIS research, and GIS education expanded beyond geography departments.</li> <li>Phase 3 (2000s-present): during which data science, big data, consumer GIS, and computer science increasingly shape geospatial practice. Geography risks losing influence unless it continues to assert why spatial thinking matters.</li> </ul> <p>Goodchild warns that this new emphasis on data as the foundation of science, often ignoring how data are assembled, their provenance, and their relationship to the real world, is especially problematic. Effective and scientifically rigorous analysis becomes difficult without ground truth: knowledge of the geographic world gained through field observation, careful description, and attention to data quality.</p> <p>Without geographic thinking, GIS risks becoming data-driven computation divorced from social context, spatial reasoning, and geographic understanding. In this sense, the earlier concern about form and process reappears here at a disciplinary scale.</p> <p>A Related Detour:</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the rise of data science raises a parallel question: what kind of field is Geographic Data Science?</p> <p>Scheider et al. (2020) argue that GDS is not yet a scientific discipline, but rather a community of practice. A scientific discipline, they contend, must have its own concepts and its own questions. GDS currently does not. It borrows concepts from Geography, methods from GIScience, Statistics, and Machine Learning, and infrastructure from Computer Science <sup>1</sup>.</p> 1. Interestingly, this argument defends GIScience rather than replacing it. GIScience is framed as a meta-science, akin to Statistics or Information Science. Its role is not to answer geographic questions directly, but to study how geographic information is represented, measured, and reasoned with.

However, GIS platforms often flatten these ideas into inflexible representations of points, lines, and polygons. As a result, GIS constrains how geographic thinking can be expressed, explored, and extended.</p> <p>While some argue that GIS primarily needs better qualitative tools, O\u2019Sullivan suggests that this would not make much difference. The deeper issue is that representational geometry itself is rigid. We do not need a whole new platform to \u201cdo GIS.\u201d Rather, it is essential to rethink the geographic representation model inside GIS and allow alternative spatial logics<sup>2</sup> to be implemented. As what he said:</p> <p>I am convinced that the task of reimagining and reconstructing GIS as a flexible tool for creating diverse human geographies \u2026 will depend on GISers taking geographical thought much more seriously than they have hitherto.</p> 2. non-Euclidean space, relational space, etc. <p>Speaking more broadly about representation, a major stumbling block for many critics of GIScience is its failure to take seriously the problematic nature of representation. Representation should be understood as process and practice, not as static objects. For example,</p> <p>The important question is not what a map is, nor what a map does, but how the map emerges through contingent, relational, context-embedded practices.</p> <p>This reframing shifts attention away from maps as finished products and toward the practices, assumptions, and decisions through which representations are produced.</p> <p>O\u2019Sullivan argues that we need to interrogate more closely what we mean by terms like related, near, and distant. Finding ways to recognize the fuzziness, ambiguity, porosity, and uncertainty of boundaries has the potential to open up new and different ways of seeing geographies. Doing so could set the stage for representing processes, events, and patterns explicitly, rather than treating familiar GIS entities as fixed and pre-given.</p> <p>Then,one way of \u201cdoing GIS\u201d today is to develop a vision that is both technical and critical. This requires taking the geographical in GIScience more seriously, and for geography to take GIScience more seriously as well. This leads to O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s primary conclusion:</p> <p>Geography and GIScience curricula at all levels should actively explore the common ground they share.</p> <p>There is no reason why an introductory GIS course cannot also be a class that critically examines fundamental geographic ideas\u2014doing so beyond a narrow focus on the technical issues that arise from working with existing representations.</p> <p>Reference:</p> <p>Goodchild, M.

At first glance these terms feel obvious and objective. But once we look closely, they turn out to be surprisingly slippery. For example, is near measured in meters, in minutes, in social connection, or in accessibility? The answer depends on context. What counts as close for walking is different from driving, and what counts as connected socially is different from geographically adjacent. Boundaries are often fuzzy, porous, or contested rather than crisp and fixed. That leads us to a deeper question: if ideas like distance, neighborhood, or boundary are modeling choices, then how we represent space matters a great deal.</p> <p>GISystems often present maps and spatial data as if they were neutral mirrors of reality. However, as Fisher (1998) argues, GIS does not simply record the world, but re-presents it through particular technical and conceptual assumptions. Every representation simplifies: it foregrounds some features, hides others, and encodes specific ways of seeing. Crisp lines replace fuzzy edges, continuous processes become discrete objects, and lived places become points or polygons. These decisions feel natural precisely because they are embedded in the tools we use, which makes them easy to overlook. Yet they matter profoundly, because they shape what questions we can ask, what patterns we can detect, and what kinds of explanations become possible. If we never question these assumptions, we risk mistaking a particular technical representation for reality itself.</p> <p>This question takes us from representation to spatial ontology, asking a more foundational question of the kind of things that we assume exist in the first place. Ontology, simply put, concerns what exists and how those things are structured. In the context of GIScience, it asks what we believe space actually is and what kinds of entities populate it. With this in mind, it makes sense to begin with the most fundamental concept in both geography and GIScience: the notion of space itself.</p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies1/#introducing-location-and-space","title":"Introducing Location and Space","text":"<p>To begin with, modern GIS is explicitly built on a notion of space defined primarily through location.

This so-called \u201cgeoatom\u201d treats every geographic fact as a combination of where something is and what it is. In this framework, space functions like a container filled with precisely located objects.</p> <p>This representation is powerful and intuitive because GPS, digital maps, and nearly all GIS operations depend on it.

A classic distinction identifies three broad perspectives: absolute, relative, and relational space. </p> <p>Absolute Space conceives of space as an empty, neutral container within which objects are placed. Things exist independently, and coordinates simply specify their positions. This view is deeply embedded in Western scientific thinking and underlies most GIS software. Raster grids, vector features, map projections, and cadastral boundaries all assume a stable frame of reference in which phenomena can be precisely located. While this model is enormously useful for measurement and administration, it also tends to privilege objects over processes and to present maps as neutral and authoritative.</p> <p>Relative Space complicates this picture by shifting attention away from fixed coordinates toward relationships among things. From this perspective, distance is not limited to Euclidean meters; it may instead be measured in travel time, cost, energy, accessibility, or social interaction. Two places that are close on a map may be functionally distant if transportation is slow, while distant places may effectively be near if they are well connected. Space, in this sense, depends on how movement and interaction occur. Relative space therefore recognizes that multiple distance metrics coexist and that different observers experience space differently.</p> <p>At the same time, it is worth noting that the boundary between absolute and relative perspectives is not sharp. Any absolute map already implies relationships, and many relative measures are computed using underlying coordinates. The two views are intertwined in practice.</p> <p>Relational Space takes this shift even further. Rather than treating space as a container at all, relational thinking argues that space is produced through processes and interactions. Entities do not simply occupy space; they emerge from networks of social, economic, political, and material relations. From this perspective, objects are not isolated units but bundles of relationships, and space itself is continually made and remade over time.</p> <p>Bringing all three conceptualizations of space together, we may recognize that the boundaries between the three is provisional and contingent rather than fixed. To put it simply, relative space can be thought of as more or less fixe structures in which things are embedded in relation to one another and are in this sense not so different from absolute space. But at the same time, relative space to the extent that their measures of relation are contingent on movement, flows, perceptions, and so on associated with processes, approximate to the relational spaces of those processes. In this case, relative spaces can be either absolute, relational, or perhaps even both.</p> <p>To O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s point, the major takeaway here is that whatever we make of these abstract ideas about space, it is important to emphasize that these three conceptualizations are just conceptualizations. As ever with models of any kind, no model is correct, but all we need it for them to be useful and each of these models has its use, which we will briefly list next.</p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies1/#situating-space-in-giscience","title":"Situating Space in GIScience","text":"<p>If geography offers these richer ontologies, however, what kind of space does GIS actually implement in practice? Despite the theoretical diversity, most GIS platforms overwhelmingly default to an absolute, coordinate-based model.

This design choice works well for many applications, but it also creates practical limitations.</p> <p>To O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s point because GIS tools assume absolute space, they often struggle when we try to work in alternative spatial logics.

It is relatively straightforward to distort areas, as shown in the examples below, according to population, travel time, or some other metric, creating a map where size reflects something other than physical area.

In many workflows, what matters is not where things sit in a fixed reference frame, but how they relate to one another. Spatial statistics, for instance, frequently rely on spatial weights matrices that encode contiguity, nearest neighbors, or distance bands. These matrices define who influences whom, allowing analysis to proceed based on relationships rather than raw coordinates. Similarly, point pattern analysis characterizes clustering or dispersion using nearest-neighbor distances, largely ignoring absolute position and focusing instead on inter-point relationships. Even certain data structures incorporate adjacency directly, treating neighborhood relations as first-class information rather than something recalculated from geometry. These approaches reveal that, in practice, we often think relationally even while our tools remain anchored in absolute space.</p> <p>Several concrete examples help make this shift visible!</p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies1/#voronoi-polygons","title":"Voronoi Polygons","text":"<p>Voronoi polygons provide a clear and intuitive example of how GIScience can move beyond absolute, coordinate-based space. Rather than defining regions using fixed administrative boundaries or arbitrary grid cells, it partitions space according to proximity relationships: every location is assigned to whichever feature it is closest to. In this formulation, space becomes something structured by distances between entities. What matters is not a point\u2019s absolute coordinates, but its relation to neighboring points. This makes Voronoi models especially useful for problems like service areas, facility location, clustering, or neighborhood definition, where \u201ccloseness\u201d is more meaningful than geometric position.

Traditional GIS formats tend to treat geometries as independent objects stored in isolation\u2014points, lines, and polygons each tied to coordinates in a fixed reference system. In contrast, PostGIS extends a relational database so that spatial features live alongside tables describing their attributes and, crucially, their relationships to other features. Spatial joins, adjacency queries, and intersection operations allow space to be modeled not simply as \u201cwhere things are\u201d but as \u201chow things connect.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>For example, in the above analysis, we are not simply mapping census block groups or bus stops as independent features. Instead, we are drawing on multiple datasets within a database, then use a spatial join <code>ST_Within</code> to ask which block groups fall within 800 meters of each stop, from which we then aggregate population counts to estimate how many people each stop serves. In other words, the analysis is defined not by where features are in absolute coordinates, but by how they relate to one another through proximity and accessibility.</p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies1/#network-analysis","title":"Network Analysis","text":"<p>Another good example is network analysis models, which push spatial thinking even further toward a fully relational conception of space by replacing continuous geometric distance with explicitly defined connections among entities. In a network, locations are not primarily defined by their coordinates but by their position within a graph of nodes and edges\u2014who is connected to whom, and at what cost. Distance becomes travel time, impedance, or flow rather than Euclidean separation. For example, the \u201cdistance\u201d between two neighborhoods might be shorter along a subway line than across a river, even if their straight-line separation is small. In this sense, the structure of the network itself creates the space of analysis. In general, the reality is that any time we define neighborhoods, whether through contiguity, k-nearest neighbors, or distance bands, we are implicitly constructing a custom relative space tailored to the question at hand.</p> <p>To finish this part of lesson on spatial ontologies, let\u2019s look at the implementation of a fun model, cellular automata, which is also brought up by O\u2019Sullivan for making this relational logic even more explicit by introducing dynamics over time. </p> \u21bb Refresh <p>In these models, each cell\u2019s state changes based solely on the states of its neighbors, meaning that space is defined entirely by local interactions rather than global coordinates. Conway\u2019s Game of Life is a classic example: patterns emerge, move, and evolve not because of their absolute position on the grid, but because of simple relational rules about adjacency. The \u201cgeography\u201d of the system is therefore produced by interactions among neighbors, not by the underlying lattice itself. Below is a computer simulation of Conway\u2019s Game of Life that you can explore. The full example is here</p> <p>Taken together, all these examples suggest that GIScience should not commit to a single \u201ctrue\u201d conception of space. Different questions demand different spatial logics. Rather than treating space as fixed and universal, it is more productive to see it as context-dependent and constructed through practice. We should always choose representations that better match the phenomena we seek to understand. Recognizing that fact is the first step toward building more thoughtful, critical, and creative forms of GIScience.</p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies2/","title":"Spatial Ontologies - Place","text":"<p>In the previous lesson, we examined how GIScience conceptualizes space. We began with the familiar absolute view of space as a fixed geometric container defined by coordinates, and then moved toward relative and relational perspectives that better capture proximity, interaction, and process. Throughout this progression, we saw how many real-world phenomena cannot be fully understood through Euclidean distance alone. Relative and relational thinking brought us closer to how the world actually works. Nevertheless, even these richer conceptions still struggle to account for how places are felt, experienced, remembered, and given meaning by the people who inhabit them. There remains a fundamental dimension of geographic life that is difficult to quantify or formalize, and it is this dimension that we call place.</p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies2/#the-representation-of-experience","title":"The Representation of Experience","text":"<p>Loosely speaking, space\u2014conceived absolutely\u2014belongs to the realm of calculation, coordinate systems, and geodesy, while place belongs to the realm of everyday life and practice, emotion, and meaning. This distinction makes intuitive sense because, in ordinary life, we rarely think in coordinates or buffers. Instead, we think in terms like home, campus, downtown, or my neighborhood.</p> <p>Formally defined, following O\u2019Sullivan, place can be understood as the intersection of space with experience and meaning, or more completely, as both a context for and a product of physical, social, economic, and cultural processes. A coordinate can be anywhere, but \u201chome\u201d cannot. A polygon may delineate a neighborhood boundary, but that boundary rarely matches how residents themselves describe their community. Places carry meaning not only because of human understanding, culture, and memory, but also because they are sites where the processes that make places are continuously shaped and reshaped by the character of those places themselves (more on that in the next lesson). In other words, place is not just where things happen: it actively participates in shaping what happens.</p> <p>Perhaps an interesting example of this lived and negotiated character of place can be seen in projects like Hoodmaps. Rather than presenting neighborhoods as official administrative boundaries, Hoodmaps crowdsources how residents feel about different areas and label them accordingly. </p> <p> </p> <p>These labels are obviously subjective, humorous, and sometimes contradictory, yet they often feel more recognizable to everyday experience than census tracts or ZIP codes. The map captures not geometry, but perception. It demonstrates that what counts as a \u201cneighborhood\u201d is not simply a polygon in a database, but a socially shared understanding built through everyday life. Feel free to swtich to another city you are interested in and explore the labels. Make sure to check which neighborhood each area of interest falls in.</p> <p>Importantly, place is not just emotional or personal; it is also social and political. Places regulate behavior and encode expectations about who belongs and what is appropriate. Certain activities may feel \u201cin place\u201d in one setting and \u201cout of place\u201d in another. In this sense, place is inherently normative. As O\u2019Sullivan illustrates through the example of graffiti, the same physical act can be interpreted very differently depending on where it occurs. Graffiti is a practice whose meaning is bound up with place and timing: what is considered vandalism in one location may be celebrated as public art in another. Graffiti is only \u201cgraffiti\u201d when it is out of place.</p> <p>To make this more concrete, consider the two images of the same vacant lot in the Frankford neighborhood of Philadelphia. In one, the lot appears abandoned, scattered with debris, and covered in unsanctioned graffiti. It may be read as neglect, disorder, or even danger. In the other, the very same space is reimagined as a community playground, with landscaping, seating, and murals integrated into a planned design. Here, similar visual elements (painted walls, open ground, informal activity) are interpreted entirely differently because the context has changed. One is labeled blight; the other, revitalization. What changed is not simply the geometry of the site, but the social meaning attached to it.</p> <p>More broadly, neighborhoods can be welcoming to some groups and exclusionary to others. Decisions about zoning, policing, or development shape who has access to particular places and who does not. In this way, place is bound up with power. It is not simply a backdrop for social life, but an active participant in structuring it.</p> <p>Understanding place is therefore essential to understanding how ideology is created and maintained. Ideological beliefs have effects precisely because they shape how people behave in and experience the world. Shared, or contested, understandings of what actions are allowable or inappropriate in particular places mean that place, and how places are defined, become central to the maintenance of power. Places are not only where social life unfolds; they are mechanisms through which social norms are reinforced, negotiated, and challenged.</p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies2/#place-in-relational-space","title":"Place in Relational Space","text":"<p>Building on our earlier discussion of relational space, we can also think of places relationally. This shift is surprisingly easy to conceptualize. A neighborhood, for example, is shaped not only by what happens inside it, but also by commuting patterns, migration histories, economic ties, and cultural exchanges that link it to elsewhere. In other words, what makes a place what it is cannot be understood in isolation. It is always connected outward.</p> <p>Doreen Massey (1991) suggests that places are processes, not things. They are constantly unfolding, being made and remade through time. Because of this, places are often messy, contradictory, and internally diverse, reinforcing their non-unitary nature. They are not coherent, bounded containers with stable identities. Furthermore, places in this sense do not have clear or fixed boundaries. Whatever uniqueness a place has is not derived solely from a set of local attributes or some purely internal history, but rather from the geographically specific sets of relations it maintains with other places and with wider social, economic, and political systems. These external relations interact with local histories to produce what we recognize as a place.</p> <p>From this perspective, what we often call a sense of place is not simply a feeling that emerges from being \u201clocal\u201d, but an understanding of how a place is situated within broader networks of connection. The character of a place can only be understood by linking it to places beyond itself. A neighborhood is shaped by where its residents work, where goods come from, where cultural influences circulate, and where histories intersect. Its identity is relational rather than self-contained. Massey reiterates this point in her later work, arguing that we cannot seriously posit space as something outside of place as lived, nor simply equate the everyday with the local. If we truly think space relationally, then space is the sum of all our connections, and in that sense deeply grounded in everyday life\u2014even when those connections stretch across the globe. </p> <p>As a caveat, however, it is also useful to consider the related concept of placelessness. If sense of place refers to the distinctiveness and meaning that emerge from lived experience and relational histories, placelessness describes the opposite tendency: environments that feel interchangeable, generic, or detached from local identity. Think of airport terminals, chain stores, shopping malls, or standardized developments that could exist almost anywhere. These spaces often lack the accumulated memories, social ties, and historical depth that give places their character. Placelessness reminds us that place is not guaranteed. It must be produced and sustained through practice. </p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies2/#situating-place-in-giscience","title":"Situating Place in GIScience","text":"<p>But experience is a tricky idea to pin down. While undeniably important, the concept of place has a long history in geography and related disciplines, yet it has also been plagued by a fundamental vagueness of definition: what exactly does the term mean, and how do we identify it in practice? This ambiguity poses a particular challenge for GIScience. If our tools are designed to represent geometry and measurable relationships, how do we represent something as subjective, contextual, and experiential as place?</p> <p>Rather than tackling head-on the challenge of formalizing the subtleties of place, GIScientists have often sidestepped the issue and focused instead on limited interpretations of place that are more amenable to formalization, and therefore computation.

This approach treats place names as labels that must ultimately be converted into coordinates or polygons through geocoding and gazetteers. Technically, this is framed as a translation problem: how do we map human ways of referring to places onto machine-readable geometry? Digital gazetteers and search engines attempt to solve this by returning a point or administrative boundary for any given name. From a computational standpoint, this is efficient and necessary. But conceptually, it is reductive. </p> <p>The problem is that place names are rarely precise. Many names are repeated across space. For example, there are dozens of \u201cSpringfields\u201d, and their intended meaning depends heavily on context. Even when a single referent exists, equating a place with its coordinates misses the point entirely. As the text bluntly notes, London is not the same thing as its latitude and longitude.  A coordinate can identify where something is, but it cannot capture what it means, how it feels, or how it is socially understood. In this sense, \u201cplace as location\u201d solves a technical indexing problem while sidestepping the richer cultural and experiential dimensions of place. It makes places legible to computers, but thinner to humans.</p> <p>A useful illustration of this limitation can be seen in interactive projects like Same Name map. In addition to showing the variations of place names across the US, we see that when different people are asked to identify or react to the same place name, their associations often vary widely depending on their personal histories and social contexts. The same label can evoke entirely different meanings for different people.</p> \u21bb Refresh"},{"location":"module2/ontologies2/#place-as-geographical-context","title":"Place as Geographical Context","text":"<p>A second, more sophisticated move in GIScience shifts attention from naming to context. Taking geographical context seriously immediately reveals the inadequacy of simplistic notions of coincidence in space as a way of understanding what it means for things to interact in place. Instead of asking \u201cWhere is this place?\u201d, researchers ask \u201cWhat surroundings affect what happens here?\u201d This perspective is often framed through the Uncertain Geographic Context Problem (UGCoP), which highlights how difficult it is to define the relevant environment influencing people\u2019s outcomes.</p> <p>For example, studies of health or mobility frequently assign individuals to the census tract where they live and treat that tract as their \u201cneighborhood.\u201d However, this effectively assumes that the activity space of each resident is confined to the census tract itself\u2014something that will only rarely be the case\u2014and furthermore assumes that the tract is somehow sealed off from everywhere else in the wider region. In reality, people commute, travel, socialize, and experience many overlapping environments throughout the day.This reveals a deeper issue: context is not fixed or uniform. Different people experience different \u201cplaces\u201d even when they share the same address. A student, a retiree, and a delivery driver might inhabit entirely different activity spaces within the same city. Any single boundary is therefore only an approximation. </p> <p>Compared to \u201cplace as location,\u201d this approach is conceptually richer because it recognizes that places are defined by relationships and exposure, not just coordinates.

If place is experiential, relational, and socially constructed, then the obvious question for GIScience becomes: can place ever be made computational?</p> <p>The first step toward making place computational is to move beyond purely geometric representations and deliberately incorporate narrative structure into maps. Rather than treating maps as neutral stacks of layers, this approach recognizes that place is experienced sequentially and interpretively. Traditional GIS layering synthesizes information analytically: each theme is added as another independent layer, and meaning is expected to emerge from visual overlap. But this logic often fragments place into components rather than presenting it as a lived whole. In contrast, narrative cartography and story mapping reorganize representation around sequence, annotation, and storytelling. </p> <p>There are many compelling examples of this approach in both static and dynamic forms. As an exampke, see the biking journey map shown here. Instead of simply plotting GPS tracks, it organizes the author\u2019s travel history into a story of movement across cities and landscapes.

Interactive projects, such as the Dark Skies map, allow users to scroll, click, and explore place through sequence and discovery. The map becomes more like a guided experience here.</p> <p>The second step takes a different direction. Instead of translating place into narrative overlays, it attempts to directly implement explicit conceptual models of place computationally. In other words, rather than adding stories to maps, this approach asks whether the underlying data structures themselves can encode theories of how places are organized and experienced. O\u2019Sullivan specifically  points to examples such as Lynch\u2019s image-of-the-city framework (paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks) as a set of perceptual elements that could be operationalized in GIS layers. Here, place is modeled not simply as geometry but as a structured configuration of meaningful features, whose combination produces a recognizable urban environment. </p> <p>Should we think of place and space as completely opposed where place is local, concrete, and particular whereas space is global, abstract, and general? Perhaps the answer to this is not that place is not concrete, grounded, real, lived, etc. It is that space is too. The local and immediate feels more concrete, because it is often visible, right there in front of us. But more remote events are no less real, even if they seem that way. Place cannot be fully computed, only approximated.

As a result, we may struggle to account for transformation effectively.</p> <p>In this lesson, we introduce a more radical spatial ontology: the idea that process, not object, is primary.

This idea can be traced back to Heraclitus\u2019s famous metaphor that we never step into the same river twice. The river is not a fixed thing; it is an ongoing flow. What appears stable is actually constant movement.</p> <p>This way of thinking has often been overshadowed in Western science by what is sometimes called \u201csubstance thinking,\u201d where we assume that objects exist first and processes happen to them later. Process philosophy reverses this logic. It suggests that change is fundamental, and that what we call \u201cthings\u201d are only temporary stabilizations within that flow.</p> <p>To situate this within a spatio-temporal ontology, several shifts, mentioned by O\u2019Sullivan, follow naturally:</p> <ol> <li>Time no longer needs to be imagined as a simple linear progression; it may be cyclical or rhythmic.</li> <li>The past and the future are not merely absent moments, but active influences on the present.</li> <li>Geographic entities are understood as dynamic processes rather than fixed physical objects. And time is not just a fourth dimension added onto three-dimensional space, but inseparable from place itself.</li> <li>Space and time are intertwined within ongoing events rather than existing as separate containers.</li> </ol> <p>Whitehead\u2019s work is especially influential here. He argues for understanding reality as constituted by process, not in terms of things located in space-time. Even apparently solid and durable entities are constantly remaking themselves. A mountain, a city, or even a person is not fixed, but an ongoing pattern of becoming. In this view, stability is something that must be explained rather than assumed. What looks permanent is simply a process that changes slowly enough for us to perceive continuity. This reframing may sound philosophically abstract, but it has very practical consequences for GIScience. Much of our software and data structures are built around stable objects stored in tables and layers\u2014points, lines, polygons, and attributes that appear fixed. Process philosophy asks us to question whether this object-centered starting point accurately reflects how the world actually works.</p> <p>Mesle\u2019s (2008) introduction to process philosophy is also very approachable. He argues that, far from being difficult, process thinking is intuitive. It is simply an effort to think clearly about the obvious truth that our world and our lives are dynamic, interrelated processes. What is actually counterintuitive, he suggests, is the idea that the world is made of independent things that endure unchanged through time. In many ways, process philosophy asks us to trust everyday experience and we already know that everything changes.</p> <p>For some process philosophers, this concern extends beyond the external world to the individual perceiving and experiencing subject. Process thinking therefore not only emphasizes change and relation, but also dissolves Western thought\u2019s habitual privileging of the conscious human mind over inert matter. Instead of centering isolated individuals acting on a passive world, both people and environments are understood as mutually constituting processes. </p> <p>Whatever flavor of process philosophy we adopt, the core implication remains the same: if events and change are fundamental, then the entities we observe as stable are simply more or less constant patterns of occurrence.</p> <p>In reality, Whitehead himself does not provide a strict methodological recipe for how to analyze the world. Instead, he offers a philosophical orientation: recognize the processual nature of reality, and recognize our oneness with that nature. For GIScience, this orientation encourages us to look beyond static snapshots and toward the dynamic processes that generate the patterns we observe.</p> \u21bb Refresh <p>       A helpful way to make Heraclitus\u2019s river metaphor is to look at a simple computer simulation. This is a small sketch that generates something that looks like a river system with tributaries, even though there is no \u201criver object\u201d in the code at all. Instead, the sketch creates many small moving agents that wander continuously across the canvas. Each agent follows a local direction field and draws a short line segment as it moves. Over time, these countless tiny movements accumulate into visible channels and branching patterns that resemble streams and tributaries. The key point is that the \u201criver\u201d is not a pre-defined thing that exists first and then changes. It only appears as a recognizable form because motion keeps happening and traces keep building up. What we perceive as a stable feature is really the temporary stabilization of repeated activity.     </p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies3/#process-space-and-place","title":"Process, Space, and Place","text":"<p>If everything is process, then what happens to space and place?</p> <p>Jim Blaut\u2019s paper Space and Process pushes this question directly. He argues that there can be no such thing as space devoid of process: every empirical concept of space must ultimately be reducible, through a chain of definitions, to some underlying concept of process. In other words, space is not something that exists first and then hosts events. Rather, space is something that emerges from events themselves.</p> <p>Space and time are not, therefore, independent realities or empty containers within which things occur. Instead, they are relations derived from processes and events. An understanding of process must precede our understanding of space and time. For our purposes, the key takeaway is simple: space, time, and place are inseparable from process.</p> <p>For Whitehead, all of these can be understood as societies of events,  where events occur together in association with one another and continually reproduce a persistent thing. What appears to endure is really a coordinated pattern of repeated happenings. Stability is not a starting point; it is an achievement.</p> <p>This perspective dissolves many familiar separations that we often take for granted: structure versus process, pattern versus change, space versus time. What we usually call \u201cstructure\u201d may simply be slow process. A road network, for example, looks static when mapped, but it is really the outcome of decades of maintenance, traffic, policy decisions, construction, and everyday use. A neighborhood is not a container with fixed contents, but a constantly evolving set of flows\u2014of people, capital, culture, and memory. </p>"},{"location":"module2/ontologies3/#process-and-patterns","title":"Process and Patterns","text":"<p>It is also worth touching on the relationship between process and patterns. If processes are fundamental, then how do we observe them? Often, only indirectly, through the patterns they leave behind.</p> <p>Quantitative geographers have long emphasized spatial patterns, although \u201cpattern\u201d itself is an ill-defined and sometimes slippery concept. What we call a pattern is often just a regularity we recognize visually or statistically. Whitehead offers a helpful way to think about this: we recognize things because we can say, \u201cthere it is again.\u201d Repetition produces pattern. Endurance is simply the repetition of similar events over time. A city block persists because similar activities recur there day after day. A river persists because water continually flows along roughly the same channel. What we see as a stable object is really the trace of repeated processes.</p> <p>Point pattern analysis, for example, explicitly asks what kinds of generative processes could produce the observed arrangement of events. In this sense, spatial statistics is already implicitly process-oriented, even if it sometimes appears focused only on snapshots. The central concern of point pattern analysis and many other branches of spatial analysis is precisely this question: what kinds of processes could yield this observed pattern? While spatial analysis is sometimes criticized for emphasizing instantaneous views of the world, it is actually much more concerned with the dynamic processes that may or may not give rise to the spatial configurations we observe.</p> <p>Mobility hotspots at the Paris Olympics0; Source: CARTO</p> <p>As an example, many practical applications of this process\u2013pattern relationship can be seen in these time-series and flow maps. See a full collection of example here.</p> <p>Importantly, the purpose of characterizing patterns is not the identification of patterns for their own sake. Patterns matter because they provide clues about the processes that produced them. At the same time, we must be cautious. The relationship between process and pattern is rarely straightforward. The same or similar processes unfolding in different contexts may yield very different patterns; conversely, very different processes can produce patterns that look remarkably similar. There is no simple one-to-one mapping between process and form.</p> <p>To put this under a GIS framework, process may exhibit many spatio-temporalities, and it is necessary to recognize this in any attempt to examine processes through spatial analysis. Local spatial statistics were not developed with this critique in mind, and it is important not to overstate their accomplishments. Nevertheless, they remain useful tools for revealing the multiple scalar and temporal dimensions of processes, especially when diverse distance metrics are deployed.</p> \u21bb Refresh <p>       As complementary way to understand this relationship and also to end the series of lesson on spatial ontologies, let's play around with another simulations. Here, clusters, trails, and swirls emerge spontaneously. These patterns are not specified in advance; they arise purely from repeated local interactions. The \u201cstructure\u201d we see is simply the accumulated trace of ongoing process. If we freeze the screen at a single moment, the pattern loses meaning. It only makes sense as something unfolding through time.
