# __Week One__  

In the first week, we will do two activities surrounding the topics we've covered in lecture. The first activity is centered around understanding what GIScience is and how much you've learned about __GIScience__ throughout your education. The second activity is based on the series of readings on the tool-science debate and asks you to apply the concepts in the readings to your own previous research project. 

## __Syllabus Comparison__

Bring one syllabus from your first GIS course or any prior GIS or spatial analysis course you have taken. In small groups, compare these syllabi and identify which topics dominate, what is introduced early versus later in the course, and where conceptual material appears relative to technical tools. As a class, we will then discuss common patterns across institutions, differences in emphasis (e.g., tool-first versus concept-first approaches), and what these curricular choices suggest about how GIS and GIScience are framed and taught.

## __The Cyclical View of GIScience__

> Wright et al (199) suggests that GIS activities lie along a continuum from tool use, through toolmaking, to GIScience. However, Fisher argues that this linear metaphor is misleading. He suggests that GIScience is better understood as a cycle, where concepts, systems, applications, and critique continuously inform one another.

__First__, please choose a spatial analysis that you've done in your previous studies or any spatial analysis method that you are familiar with. Examples include but are not limited to accessibility analysis, land-use classification, hotspot detection, disease predicion, spatial regression, etc. 

Describe what the method was used for and what question it was supposed to answer. 

__Then__, sketch out Wright’s tool–science continuum and try to place your chosen analysis on it. While doing so, think about:

- Was I mostly using an existing tool
- Was I modifying or designing methods?
- Was I asking general questions about spatial representation or inference?

__Finally__, redraw the continuum as a cycle as demonstrated by Fisher. Please label the four stages of the cycle, which include:

- Established paradigms are implemented and realised in operational systems
- Applications using systems test the concepts of the spatial science embedded in the system
- Experimental and conceptual studies develop new concepts
- New concepts become established as part of spatial science
- Critical evaluation through critique in the literature
