# __Course Information__  

In this course, we will study GIScience as the science of geographic information—focusing not only on how spatial analyses are performed, but on the conceptual decisions that make them possible. We examine how geographic phenomena are conceptualized, translated into representations, analyzed through inference, conveyed through communication, and assessed through validation.Through readings, discussions, in-class activities,and a final research proposal, we will engage with foundational questions of ontology, representation, inference, uncertainty, reproducibility, ethics, and beyond that shape how spatial knowledge is produced and evaluated.
